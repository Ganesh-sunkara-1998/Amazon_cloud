RDS(Relational Database service):
    By using this service we can manage entire end to end database .
    Database:
      . A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed,managed,and updated.
    Relational Database:
      . which is also called Relational database management systems (RDMS) or Structed Query language (SQL) database.
      . The most popular of these are "Microsoft SQL server","Oracle Database","MySQL",and IBMDB2.
      . which is mostly used to store data for web applications, typically as part of the popular LAMP stack.
    Non-Relational Database:
      . Also called "NoSQL" databases
      . The most popular being "MongoDB","DocumentDB","Cassandra","Coachbase","HBase","Redis" and "Neo4j".
      . These databases are usually grouped into four categories:-
          . Key-value stores
          . Graph Stores
          . Colum stores
          . And Documentation Stores

  . Amazon Relational Database service (RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to setup, Operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
      including License.
  . You can have Automated backups performed when you need them, or manually create your own backup snapshot. you can use these backups to restore a database.
  . you can get high availability with a primary instance and a synchronous secondary instance that you can fail over to when problems occur.

  DB-Instances:
    . A DB Instance is an isolated database environment in the cloud
    . Each DB instance runs a DB engine. (Your database template)
    . Amazon RDS currently supports the "MYSQL","MariaDB","PostgreSQL","Oracle",and "microsoft SQL" server DB engines.
        . And Also Amazon also created own database which is called "AWS Aurora".
        . Aurora and MYSQL both are same by using mysql template amazon has configure and setup own database. 
    . The Computation and memory capacity of a DB Instance is determined by its DB Instance class.
    . DB Instance storage comes in three types:-
          . Magnetic
          . General Purpose (SSD)
          . Provisioned IOPs (PIOPS)
    . You can your DB instances in several Availability zones, An option called Multi-AZ deployment.

        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html

  DB Parameter Group:
    . DB parameter groups act as a container for engine configuration values that are appiled to one or more DB instances.

  High Availabilty:
      . Amazon RDS provides high avaialbility and failover support for DB instances using multi-AZ deployments.
      . Multi-AZ deployments for Oracle,PostgreSQl,MYSQL and MariaDB Db instances use Amazon's failover technology.
      . SQL DB instances use SQL server mirroring.
         . If you choose SQL server Mirroring by default it will maintain primary and secondary database instances.
      . In a multi-AZ depolyment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Avaliability zone.
      . The High Avaliability Feature is not a scaling solution for read-only senarios.
      . You cannot use a standby replica to server read traffic.
      . To service read-only read only traffic, you should use a Read Replica. 

  Read Replica:
      . You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the Read replica.
      . Creating Amazon RDS Read Replicas either in the same AWS region as the source DB instance, or in a seperate AWS region.
      . The Read Replica Operates as a DB Instances that allows only read-only connections.

RDS setup:
# Aws console >> Database >> create database >> choose database method >> Database Options >> templates >> Give some Authentication details for DB 
# click on Create Database {It will take around 10-15 mins to setup your database} >> Login through RDS endpoint >> 
  . Login RDS from EC2:
      . Install mysql client package # apt-get install mysql-client
      # mysql -h <your-RDS-endpoint> -P 3306 -u dbmaster -p
  . Login RDS on windows:
      . Install RDS client package. # mysqlbench

SQL Database:
    list of databases: # show databases;
    switch in to particular database: # use <your database name>;
    Check inside database db list of tables: # show tables;
    Create Table in side database: # CREATE TABLE Students (studentID int, LastName varchar(255), FirstName varchar(255), City varchar(255));
    Insert Records into table: # INSERT INTO  Students (studentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ("001","Kumar","Anil","Singpure")
    Retrive records from your table: # select * from Students;
    Making specific queries: 
        . Select StudentID from Students WHERE (LastName="Reddy")
        . Select StudentID, city from Students Where (LastName="Reddy")
    Delete tables: # drop tables Students;
    Switch back to mysql query to backend command prompt: # exit;
      
RDS-instance Modify:
# select your DB >> click on modify >> 

  Database creation method:
      Standard Creation:
          . You set all of configuration options,including ones for availiability,security,backups,and maintenance.
      Easy Creation:
          . Use recommended best-pratice configurations. some configuration options can be changed after the database is created.    

  Database Options:
      . MYSQL
      . MariaDB  
      . PostgreSQL
      . Oracle
      . microsoft SQL
     # oracle,PostgreSQL,Server microsoftSQL,MariaDB all thise are pay for licensed charge.
      > Above all database we will get a billing resource utilisation and licensed charged both charges are apply.

    Templates:
        . Production 
        . Dev/Test  
        . free tier
        # Production Dev/test you will pay for charge.
        > Production and Dev/Test you will get "multi-AZ feature" and "Read Replica feature"

--> MySQL and Amazon Aurora default port number is "3306" .
--> By default RDS provided upto 35 days backup retention period. based on number of days backup you will pay for charge.
--> "Enable enhanced monitoring" and "Logs export" both are pay for charge.
--> RDS service automatically Upgrading your exisiting database services.
--> RDS by default we don't have a operating system Activities

Multi agent: It means it will provisioning to database instance one is for main instance and another one is standby instance.
      . Whenever Your Primary instance is fail standby instance acts as a primary and manage our data.
      
Read Repica: Incase if you reduce incoming Application node to our primary database we can create read replica data. 
      . your replica database query's can handle read query's also.
  
Create Read Replica:
    # Actions >> Click on read replica >> choose your read replica region 
Manual Backup DB Instance:
    # Actions >> click on take snapshots >> 
      . It will take intime database 
Automactic DB Backup:
  # Actios >> Backup >> 

Parameter Group: 
  . It will allows to create and allows your own customised database.
  . Once if you create database group for parameter group we can modify by default your database engine parameters.
  # select your db group >> click on parameter group >> 
  . Any database by default more than hundreads of parameters are there.
  . we can change default time zone From UTC to India.

Subnet Group:
  # subnet Group >> create subnet group >> add subnets

Burst Performance:
    . Larger volumes have higher base performance levels and accumulate I/O credits faster. 
    . I/O credits represent the available bandwidth that your General Purpose SSD storage can use to burst large amounts of I/O when more than the base level of performance is needed. 
    . The more I/O credits your storage has for I/O, the more time it can burst beyond its base performance level and the better it performs when your workload requires more performance. 
    . This initial credit balance is enough to sustain a burst performance of 3,000 IOPS for 30 minutes.
    . When your storage requires more than the base performance I/O level, it uses I/O credits in the I/O credit balance to burst to the required performance level.
    . Such a burst goes to a maximum of 3,000 IOPS.
    . Storage larger than 1,000 GiB has a base performance that is equal or greater than the maximum burst performance.
    . The burst duration of your storage depends on the size of the storage, the burst IOPS required, and the I/O credit balance when the burst begins.
                                      
                                      
                                      (Credit Balance)
           Burst duration =  --------------------------------------
                              (Burst IOPS) - 3*(Storage size in GiB)
