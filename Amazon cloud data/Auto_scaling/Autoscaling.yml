DesiredCapacity: 
Based on my reading, in layman's terms, DesiredCapacity value is automatically updated on scale-in and scale-out events.
In other words,Scale-in or Scale-out are done by decreasing or increasing the DesiredCapacity value.

Enable Auto Scaling Group Metrics:
When you enable Auto Scaling group metrics, Auto Scaling sends sampled data to CloudWatch every minute.
