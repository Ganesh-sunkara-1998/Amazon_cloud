Lambda:  # Region Based Service

    . AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code "without provisioning or managing servers".
           . without Provisoing means without use any security groups or AWS resources because Lambda is a server less. 
    . You pay only for the "compute time you consume" - there is no charge when your code is not running.
    . AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging.
    . No server to maintain - "serverless".
    . AWS Lambda supports (currently Node.js, Java, C#, Go and Python).
    . 128 MB of Memory and the lowest CPU power, to 3008 MB of Memory and the highest CPU power.
        . Sutiable:
        . It is sutiable for micro or small things only.
        . It is not sutiable for large databases.

    . Functions can run between "100ms and 15 minutes" in a length.
    . Pricing depends on "resource level chosen,time of execution".
    . Saves money as compute is used only when required.
    . Supports IAM role and VPC. 
    . Lambda cloud be triggered as result of events happening from many AWS services like s3.
    . Lambda starts within milliseconds in responce to an event and hence reponce is very fast.

    . when should you consider Lambda instead of EC2 :
        . For stand-alone(stateless) code execution, which gets excuted and then stores the result somewhere like database,S3.
        . When don't want to maintain servers (Os update,security,scalability etc).
            Stateless: Code is executed and stored code in some where location 
    # Lambda Functions are running container based Environment "Docker"
    
Lambda is also same like Beanstalk:
  Beanstalk it will create your AWS resources for your application.

Advantages of Lambda function:
  . If you use EC2-resources and Benastalk you will pay for charge every min or sec but your code is running on every week or month. 
  . In Lambda you will pay for only code running period.
  . We no need to create AWS resources.

Disadvantage:
    . It is sutibale only small or micro codes only it is 128 MB of Memory and the lowest CPU power, to 3008 MB of Memory and the highest CPU power.

When Should I Use AWS Lambda:
    . AWS Lambda is an ideal compute platform for many application scenarios.
    . When using AWS Lambda, you are responsible only for your code.
    . AWS Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources.
    . AWS Lambda to perform operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including provisioning capacity, monitoring fleet health, applying security patches, deploying your code, and monitoring and logging your Lambda functions.
