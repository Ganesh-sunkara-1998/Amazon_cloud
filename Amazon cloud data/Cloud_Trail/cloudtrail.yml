Cloud Trail:
    . AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. 
    . Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. 
    . Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.
    . CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create it.
    . When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event.
    . You can easily view events in the CloudTrail console by going to Event history.
    . Event history allows you to view, search, and download the past 90 days of activity in your AWS account.
    . Next, from the Advanced section, you can optionally configure a Log file prefix. By default, the logs will automatically get stored under a folder-like hierarchy that is usually of the form AWSLogs/ACCOUNT_ID/CloudTrail/REGION.
