        # Network..............

Networking:
        --> Interconnected collection of multiple Autonomous computers.
        --> When two or more computers are connected together for changing information they form a network.
        --> Networks are effective way to share the information :- Mail.

        # It will connect between one machine to another machine and it will share data between one machine to another machine.
    
IP Address and Subnetting:
    In Network Basically we have a two type of IP-address.
        IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):
                --> Most of the real time senarios we can use IPv4.
                --> It contains 32-bits address.
                --> IPv4 theree are classified in to 5 classes. Based on number of class we will get range of it.
                --> As of now our VPC is also supported IPv4 protocol.

          #    CLASS                IP-ADDRESS            DEFAULT SUBNET MASK
              Class A                 0-126                 255.0.0.0
                (Large network used for Organisation level):
              Class B                 128-191               255.255.0.0
                (Middle range network like billings small resources):
              Class C                 192-223               255.255.255.0
                (Use for local network single room or within the home):
              Class D                 224-239                   N/A
              Class E                 240-255                   N/A

 --> 127.0.0.0 -127.255.255.255 is a loop back address used for testing purpose. within your local machine.

                --> Based on subnet mask we will get number of Ip- Address for that specific network.
                --> In default subnet mask 1st digit is network id and then next three digits are subnet id's or host id's.
                        --> Network Id is never modified and then next three digits are we can modified.
                        # Network Id is a static Id. And remaining three id's are Host id's and it is dynamically changed.
                        # Based on classes we can choose number of digits have Network Id's and then remaining have host id's.
                 # Based on classes we will number of Id's even you define CIDR block also.
                         CIDR: --> Crossless Inter Domain Routing. 
                        --> Based on this CIDR block we will get a number of IP address and we can allocated number of instances.
                        --> Again this CIDR block also depend on class 
                        for example: 
                                        192.168.0.0.0/16 means upto 65,000 ip address.--> Network Range

        # By default Amazon provided Class A type of network.
               But before cloud based on your requirment we can choose number of Ip address based on classes.
        IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):
                --> This is the latest version we can use IPv6.
                --> But still in real time senarios we can use IPv4.
                --> It contains 128-bits address.
                --> This type of IP-address look like mac Ip address.

        
subnet: Main use of this subnet is to improve this network performance.
        # for example we have large network we need divide that large network into small network which is called subnet.
        
        --> A subnet is logical subdivision of an IP address.
        --> The process of dividing a network into two or more networks is called networking.
        --> The main purpose of subnetting is improve network performance and security is another benefit of subnetting.
        --> Even that multiple networks is also created under one main network.
        --> To understanding subnetting, we do need some basic knowledge such as subnet mask, networkId, Hostid, and broadcast id.
                --> for example one network is divided into two subnets one is for private network anthoer one is for public network. based on resources we can arrange it.
                --> for example we can choose main network either we can deploy only private network or public network.
                # Based on n number of networks we can divide.
        
   
   SUBNET:      1     2    4   8    16   32   64   128  256    
   HOST:       256   128   64   32  16   8     4    2    1
   SUBNETMASK: /24   /25  /26  /27  /28  /29  /30   /31  /32

   --> Based on subnet maskes we get number of hosts.
   --> By using global Ip address global calculator we can find list of ip address. or else by using formula also we can find list of ip address.
                # 2power n -2           n= 32-CIDR block range (16) 
        --> 32-bits because this network range supported IPv4 version.



Traditional Way:
        --> In that network Ip address 2 address are allocated to network and Broadcast.
                --> As per traditional network policy. 1st Ip-address are allocated to network address and last ip-address are allcoated to broadcast policy.remaining are ready to use address.
AWS services senario:
        --> The first four IP address and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance.
                for example: In a subnet with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 and we will get total 256 IP address.
                             10.0.0.0: Network address.
                             10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
                             10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP-address of the DNS server is always the base of the VPC netowrk range.
                             10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
                             10.0.0.255: Netowrk Board cast address. we do not support Baordcast in a VPC therefore we reserve this address.
                --> After creating subnets we can choose those subnets are used for public or private.
                # main Network Ip address means VPC in our cloud senario.

Private Network: We can't access through outside public. which can access priavtely. (or) we are unable to access one location to another location. 
Public Network: we can access throughout the internet.
